# Easing Function Visualizer
A python library of easing functions as well as a visualizer that acts as an example usage

Adapted from [Andrey Sitnik](https://sitnik.ru/en/) and [Ivan Solovev](https://solovev.one/)'s [easings.net](https://easings.net/)

## Description
**Easing functions** specify the rate of change of a parameter over time.

Objects in real life donâ€™t just start and stop instantly, and almost never move at a constant speed. When we open a drawer, we first move it quickly, 
and slow it down as it comes out. Drop something on the floor, and it will first accelerate downwards, and then bounce back up after hitting the floor.[[1]](https://easings.net/)

## Usage
In `main.py`, change the function call to any of the easing functions in `ease_functions.py`.
